# Decode Studio Signal Server Client

A client for the `studio-signal-server` project. Contains all of the client code in addition to the common types used in the messaging protocol between `studio-signal-server` and the client. As such `studio-signal-server` depends on this client for the types.

## Development

We donâ€™t directly develop `studio-signal-client`. Instead launch either `studio-desktop` or `studio-web` in development mode and edit the code for `studio-signal-client` and the code will automatically reload.
