# Decode JavaScript Utilities

Assorted JavaScript utilities that can be used in any JavaScript environment.

Instead of using a large project like Lodash (which often could be typed better) the idea is to put any small, useful, utility functions which are commonly used throughout universe in this project and then import them from anywhere.

We can also put in higher level utilities that are outside the scope of a Lodash-like library such as an `EventEmitter` class.
