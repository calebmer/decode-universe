# Decode Universe Workflow

All the code that powers our custom workflow for Decode Universe. The `workflow` command tool is defined in `./bin/workflow` and all the command modules are found in `./commands`.

The goal for the workflow tool is to provide a delightful and easy to learn development experience. This means all of the inherent complexities that this tool controls should be hidden to the developer by a clean API. However, the experience does not have to be generally applicable to all open source developers. Instead the experience is heavily customized to the goals of Decode Universe.
